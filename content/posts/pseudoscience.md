# Pseudoscience

## Definition
Pseudoscience consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that claim to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method.

## Common Connotations of Pseudoscience
All voodoo magic, ouija boards, superstitious explanations for natural observations, ghosts, god etc are considered Pseudoscience. Good that Scientists know that they can’t answer questions related to these. Why?

## Science means (and it’s limitations)

The Scientific Method Workflow
There is an inherent flaw in the methods of Scientific Study. One is, it is applicable only to phenomena which are perceivable(manifest only). Secondly, it has to be repeatable and verifiable. Not all phenomena are repeatable and verifiable. For example, Big Bang and Evolution doesn’t fit in scientific method because it is not repeatable and verifiable.

Sadly, scientists consider evolution and big bang scientific even-though they don’t fit in scientific methodology. Second Sad thing is, people think anything unscientific has to be rejected as nonsense. It is the conditional upbringing of society to think only in terms of Science and philosophers are kept moot in all these respects, where in fact, Philosophers play a major role in these areas.

It is the role of philosophers to address such questions using the tolls of logic and reasoning to evaluate the worthiness of the subject under study. In fact, philosophers can turn down the complete scientific methodology for a better framework if they need to.

## Is Pseudoscience Scientific?
The above title is an oxymoron in the sense that pseudoscience is not scientific. But the word Scientific has a connotation that the topics being worthy of study and attention. But if we dump the idea of Scientific as something which becomes repeatable and verifiable by everyone, then it is a big Yes. Pseudoscience topics are fields which science can’t answer questions due to the inherent quality of Science being the study of repeatable and observable phenomena. 

In fact, Physicists talk about Big Bang, Darwinists talk about evolution which are, according to Scientists’s definition of Science, classified as Pseudoscience. We can’t repeat Big Bang, we never observed evolution in first place(count the number of apes in forest which has turned to modern day man!!) and have no proper evidence for evolution. It is just that some dallying scientists sitting in an armchair writing his next pop science book misleading public masses who believes in all this. He is definitely a good novelist(fantasy genre perhaps) and writes a lot of science fiction under the hood of science communication.

So, Pseudoscience means some sections which can’t be studied and answered by Science. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not trash, and it is not to be ignored because it is not scientific.
